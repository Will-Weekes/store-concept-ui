Idea:
add - filter function to only show products in the productsTable with specific attributes
add - Out of stock indicator 
add - Mock "quantity" "add to basket" and "Purchase" functions that deduct quantity of X product from products.json
add - Mock "backend" page where products.Json can be modified (change amount in stock e.c.t)
add - Global background to display black transparent mask over all content when overlay is visible
change - products__Overlay overlayContent always has the same dimensions irrespective of contents

In Progress:
add - Overlay with product details shows when product is clicked in list 
add - CSS to make page look presentable
